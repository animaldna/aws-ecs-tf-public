# API Infrastructure - ECS & Terraform
This is a Terraform project to manage the infrastructure for a [demo catalog API.](https://github.com/animaldna/catalog-api)

This version runs ECS from public subnets and relies on an ALB + security groups to control access. It's less secure, but cheaper than running a [NAT gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) (or NAT instance).

<!-- The private version is [available in this repo ]()(coming soon).-->

## Additional Info
This setup isn't *fully* managed by Terraform. Managing backend config resources (S3 + DynamoDB) in the same TF project proved problematic, so those were created manually and are passed to TF.

The Route 53 hosted zone was also created outside of Terraform. Most domains are already registered and setup when a new service is created, as was the case with mine.

**This project is meant to manage infrastructure only, NOT application deployment.** 

The `image` variable is technically meant to be a placeholder, as a deploy script handles task definition updates outside of Terraform. <!--[You can read more about this setup here ]()(coming soon).--> The default right now is a public sleep container. Pass something meaningful when launching, otherwise you'll get 503 errors from the load balancer.


## CI/CD Pipeline
TBD

## Requirements
- Terraform v1.1.2
- S3 bucket to store state files
- DynamoDB table for state locking
- Appropriate IAM permissions
- Route 53 hosted zone
- Certificate Manager SSL cert for domain (temporary)

## Usage
Update the backend config file(s) in [backends/](/backends) to use your own resource names and options.
```
bucket         = "your-state-bucket"
key            = "your-key-here/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "your-aws-region"
encrypt        = true||false
dynamodb_table = "your-state-lock-table-name"
```

Initialize Terraform with a backend config and variables. I use .tfvars files when working locally and var flags when running from a CI pipeline.

```sh
terraform init -backend-config="dev.s3.tfbackend" -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

Validate your project:

```sh
terraform validate
```

Apply (or plan if you'd like to review first):
```sh
terraform apply|plan -var-file="dev.tfvars"
```

To destroy resources:
```sh
terraform destroy -var-file"dev.tfvars"
```

## Known Issues
- Inconsistent plan errors on first apply (only on dev?). AWS provider issue, see [#19583](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/19583). Current workaround to simply reapply.

## TODOs
### CircleCI
- [x] Conditional CircleCI jobs - don't need stage env for small changes
- [ ] Pull last stable image to use in task def for stage builds
- [ ] Slack approvals
- [ ] Slack notifications for build fail/success
- [ ] Add tflint job
- [ ] Add CI workflow diagram
- [ ] Fix issue with using dev context
- [ ] Optional job for stage branch only
- [ ] Optional job for dev branch only

### Terraform
- [x] Container logging (ecs)
- [x] Auto scaling
- [x] Sort out separation of environments and state management
- [ ] Load testing
- [ ] Dynamic ports (ecs)
- [ ] Dynamic ACM cert
- [ ] Add safe IPs to SGs for SSH access (sgs)
- [ ] Restrict ECS roles (iam)
- [ ] NACL template (vpc)

**Articles of note:**
- [Terraform Dynamic Subnets](https://medium.com/prodopsio/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets-455619dd1977)
- [Terraform cidrsubnet function](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/cidrsubnet)
- [Terraform cidrsubnet deconstructed](http://blog.itsjustcode.net/blog/2017/11/18/terraform-cidrsubnet-deconstructed/)

**Things I might eventually test:**
- Maybe replace destroy checkout with more specific persistence
- Need to persist workspace after apply?
- Save tfplans to S3
